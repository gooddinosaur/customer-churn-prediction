# Customer Churn Prediction for a Telecommunications Company

## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors that influence customer churn in a telecommunications company and to build a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to churn. By identifying these at-risk customers, the business can proactively develop targeted retention strategies to reduce revenue loss.

The entire process, from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to model building and evaluation, is documented in the `Customer_Churn.ipynb` notebook.

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle.
